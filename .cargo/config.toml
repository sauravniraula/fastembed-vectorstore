[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# Avoid relying on GCC's out-of-line atomics on aarch64 (which generate
# references to symbols like `__aarch64_cas8_sync` that may not be available
# or linked on all target systems, e.g. Amazon Linux 2023).
# Disabling `outline-atomics` makes Rust emit inline atomics instead,
# removing the dependency on those external symbols and fixing
# runtime ImportErrors when loading the extension module.
